# traffic-management-system
To set up and run the AI-based traffic management system as described, you need to organize your project files properly. Here’s a step-by-step guide on where to save each file and what input is required to run the application:

1. Project Structure
Organize your project files in the following directory structure:

traffic-management-system/
│
├── app.py                    # Backend Flask application
├── your_video_path.mp4       # Video file to be processed (Replace with actual path)
│
├── templates/                # Folder for HTML templates
│   └── index.html            # Frontend HTML file
│
├── static/                   # Folder for static files (CSS, JS)
│   ├── styles.css            # CSS file for styling
│   └── script.js             # JavaScript file for dynamic content
│
└── requirements.txt          # Optional: List of dependencies for easy setup

2. Saving Files
  app.py: Save this file in the root directory of your project (traffic-management-system/).
  index.html: Save this file inside the templates/ folder (traffic-management-system/templates/).
  styles.css and script.js: Save these files inside the static/ folder (traffic-management-system/static/).
  your_video_path.mp4: Place your video file in the root directory or specify the correct path in app.py. Replace 'your_video_path.mp4' with the actual path to your video file in the process_video_feed() function 
  in app.py.

3. Running the Application
After you have saved all files in the correct directories, follow these steps to run the application:

3.1. Set Up Your Python Environment
  Navigate to Your Project Directory:
  Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to your project directory (traffic-management-system/):
  cd path/to/traffic-management-system/

  Install Required Libraries:
  If you haven’t already, create a virtual environment (optional but recommended) and install the required libraries:
  python -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
  pip install flask opencv-python ultralytics

  Optionally, you can create a requirements.txt file for easier setup in the future:

  flask
  opencv-python
  ultralytics

  Then install dependencies with:
  pip install -r requirements.txt

3.2. Run the Flask Server
  Start the Flask server by running app.py:
  python app.py

3.3. Access the Frontend
  Once the server is running, open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000/.

4. What Input is Needed After Running app.py?
  Video Path: Ensure the video file path is correct in your app.py. If using a different video file, update the video_path variable in the process_video_feed() function with the path to your video file.
  User Input: No direct user input is needed after running app.py. The system automatically processes the video feed and updates the frontend. However, if the video or setup changes, you may need to restart the 
  server.

5. Testing the Application
  Ensure Video Playback: Check that your video feed is playing correctly and that vehicle counts and signal statuses are updating in real-time.
  Monitor Console: Keep an eye on the terminal or command prompt where app.py is running for any errors or logs that could indicate issues with the video processing or server setup.
  By following these steps, you should have a fully functional AI-based traffic management system running locally, with a dynamic frontend connected to your backend model.
